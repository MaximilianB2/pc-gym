## Description & Equations
The multistage extraction column is a key unit operation in chemical engineering that enables mass transfer between liquid and gas phases across multiple theoretical stages, described by coupled differential equations representing the dynamic concentration changes in each phase:

\begin{align}
  \nonumber\frac{\mathrm{d}X_i}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{L}{V_L}(X_{i-1}-X_i) - K_{La}\left(X_i - \frac{Y_i}{m}\right)\\
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \nonumber\frac{\mathrm{d}Y_i}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{G}{V_G}(Y_{i+1}-Y_i) + K_{La}\left(X_i - \frac{Y_i}{m}\right)\\
\end{align}

Where the concentration of the solute in the liquid and gas at each stage, $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the state variables, $\mathbf{x} = [X_1..X_{10},Y_1...Y_{10}]^\intercal  \in \mathbb{R}^{10}$. The action variables are the flowrate of the gas and liquid phases through the column, $\mathbf{u} = [L, G]^\intercal \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

## Observation
The observation of the `Multistage Extraction` environment provides information on the state variables and their associated setpoints (if they exist) at the current timestep. The observation is an array of shape `(1, 10 + N_SP)` where `N_SP` is the number of setpoints. Therefore, the observation when there a setpoint exists for $X_1$ and $Y_1$ is
``[X_n..., Y_n..., X_1, Y_1]``.

## Action
The action space is a `ContinuousBox` of `[[5,10],[500,1000]]` which corresponds to a liquid phase flowrate between 5 m$^3$/hr and 500 m$^3$/hr and a gas phase flowrate between 10 m$^3$/hr and 1000 m$^3$/hr.

## Reward

The reward is a continuous value corresponding to square error of the state and its setpoint. For multiple states, these are scaled with a factor (`r_scale`)and summed to give a single value.
