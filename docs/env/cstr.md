## Description & Equations
The continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is a system which converts species A to species B via the reaction: A  â†’  B. The reactor's temperature is controlled by a cooling jacket. The following system of equations describes the system:


\begin{align}
  \nonumber\frac{\mathrm{d}C_A}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{q}{V}(C_{A_f} - C_A) - kC_Ae^{\frac{-E_A}{RT}}\\
\end{align}
\begin{align}
  \nonumber\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \frac{q}{V}(T_f - T) -\frac{\Delta H_R}{\rho C_p}kC_Ae^{\frac{-E_A}{RT}} + \frac{UA}{\rho C_p V}(T_c - T)
\end{align}
where $C_A$, the concentration of species A in the reactor, and $T$, the temperature of the reactor, are the state variables, $\mathbf{x} = [C_A, T]^\intercal \in \mathbb{R}^2$ while, $u = T_c$, the cooling water temperature, is the action variable.

## Observation
The observation of the `CSTR` environment provides information on the state variables and their associated setpoints (if they exist) at the current timestep. The observation is an array of shape `(1, 2 + N_SP)` where `N_SP` is the number of setpoints. Therefore, the observation when there exist a setpoint for both states is
``[CA, T, CA_Setpoint, T_Setpoint]``.

## Action
The action space is a `ContinuousBox` of `[290,302]` which corresponds to a jacket temperature between 290 K and 302 K.

## Reward

The reward is a continuous value corresponding to square error of the state and its setpoint. For multiple states, these are scaled with a factor (`r_scale`) and summed to give a single value.
